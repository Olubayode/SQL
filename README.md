# SQL
Understaning STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE (SQL)
SQL is a programming language used for managing or querying data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS). A relational database is a collection of data with pre-defined relationships between them. It consists of tables with rows and columns.
There are a number of SQL libraries that could be used with python such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy. My focus would be SQLite library. This library allows us to interact with an SQLite database. SQLite databases are serverless and self-contained, since they read and write data to a file. To connect to a database, we use the conect class of the SQLite library. Theis class establishes a connection to a database file if it already exixts or create a new database file if doesnt exist.
